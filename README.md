# Random Quote Generator

## Description
The Random Quote Generator is a basic web app based on public  API called **Random Quote Generator**, which aims to show the users some random quotes. The background of the application that the user  uses has images that are changed in intervals providing the user with a pleasing or chill feeling feeling. It is an interesting web application, which demonstrates my understanding on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and organizational form.
